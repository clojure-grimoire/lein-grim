# lein-grim

A Leiningen plugin for generating [Grimoire](https://github.com/clojure-grimoire/grimoire) documentation folder structures using [lib-grimoire](https://github.com/clojure-grimoire/lib-grimoire) and [tools.namespace](https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace).

## Usage

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/org.clojure-grimoire/lein-grim/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/org.clojure-grimoire/lein-grim)

In `.lein/profiles.clj`, add lein-grim to your leiningen `:dependencies` and create the lein-grim alias:

```
{:user
   {:dependencies [org.clojure-grimoire/lein-grim <latest version>]}
   {:aliases
     {"grim" ["run" "-m" "grimoire.doc"
              ,,:project/group
              ,,:project/name
              ,,:project/version
              ,,nil]}}}
```

**FOR FULL DOCS** simply run `lein grim help`.

> Usage: lein grim [opts] [src|:src|source|:source] <platform> <dst>
>      : lein grim [opts] [artifact|:artifact] <platform> <groupid> <artifactid> <version> <dst>
> 
>   In source mode, lein-grim traverses the source paths of the current project,
>   enumerating and documenting all namespaces. This is intended for documenting
>   projects for which you have both source and a lein project.
> 
>   In artifact mode, lein-grim traverses an artifact on the classpath enumerating
>   and documenting the namespaces therein. This is intended for documenting
>   projects such as clojure.core which may not exist as a covenient lein project
>   but which do exist as artifacts.
> 
>   Both modes accept the following options which must be specified in order or
>   omitted.
> 
>   Arguments
>   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>   <platform>
>     One of clj cljs or cljclr. Indicates what Clojure platform is being
>   documented. Only one may be selected at a time. At present, only clj is
>   supported.
> 
>   <groupid>
>     A string naming the Maven group of the artifact being documented.
> 
>   <artifactid>
>     A string naming the Maven artifactId of the artifact being documented.
> 
>   <version>
>     A string giving the Maven version of the artifact being documented.
> 
>   <dst>
>     A string naming the file path of a directory where the generated
>   documentation will be stored.
> 
>   Options
>   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>   --specials <file>
>     Specifies an EDN map from platform strings to namespaced symbols to
>   metadata. Symbols listed in this file will be added to the generated
>   documentation with the specified metadata. If specified, specials must be the
>   1st option given.
> 
>   --clobber [true | false]
>     Enables or disables overwriting metadata which already exists. When
>   disabled, attempting to write metadata to a symbol in an artifact which has
>   already been documented will generate a warning. Should be enabled only if
>   re-generating documentation in place without cleaning the target dir or if the
>   specials file should _overwrite_ generated documentation. If specified, this
>   option may be proceeded only by specials. Other values than true or false will
>   be interpreted as false.

### Source

**DUE TO A BUG IN LEIN THIS MODE IS BROKEN**.
Do _not_ attempt to use this mode, it'll fail for reasons beyond my control.
technomancy/leiningen#1835 is the issue in question.
Until the next Leiningen release I'm afraid this feature is simply broken.

Source usage traverses the leingen source paths of a lein project, loading namespaces defined in your source files and generating Grimoire documentation written into the target directory you specify.
Here the directory `doc` is used as the target, however it is reccomended that you provide to package Grimoire documentation blobs independently from your source code so that individuals interested in hosting Grimoire instances can use it as a submodule or other resource.

```
$ cd my-project
$ lein grim src clj doc/
```

### Artifact

Some interesting objects such as the Clojure core don't have nice leiningen projects which can be introspected.
In this case, lein-grim can introspect a jar as added to the classpath by leiningen from `.m2`, locate all namespaces and defs in the targeted jar and generate documentation without source.

```
$ lein new victim
$ cd victim
$ lein grim artifact clj org.clojure clojure 1.6.0 doc/
```

Here I generated an empty project as a vehicle for getting an instance of Clojure 1.6.0 on the lein classpath and then invoked lein-grim to write Grimoire documentation for all of clojure.core into the folder `doc`.

**Note** In the special case of clojure.core, lein-grim will ignore `clojure.parallel` due to its dependency on non-standard jars which kill documentation generation.

**Note** Normally you have to add the artifact you want to introspect to the `:dependencies` in `project.clj`. This step wasn't necessary in the example above, because `[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]` is in there by default.
